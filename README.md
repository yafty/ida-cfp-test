# IDA CFP Test
Largely autogenerated C99 files for stress testing the IDA-CFP project.

## Test Suite
To test some of the functionality supported within IDA-CFP, execute the `run.py` file using some of the following command line arguments.

```
python3 run.py -v ../test/csource/csource_test1.c
```

After that command completes, the `bundle.json` file will be dropped to disk under the `out/` directory.
```
ls -l out/
bundle.json
```

Then load and disassemble (using IDA Free) the corresponding compiled and obfuscated version of that same `csource_test1.c` file. You can find the compiled binaries under the `test/obfuscated_executables/` directory. To run the IDC script look under `File->Script File...` in the upper left hand corner of the IDA GUI.
